so

what is the structure?

the essence?

- its real applications that communicate through a simulated network
- it uses the extupperethernet interface to separate the simulation and the real world
at the ethernet interface/link layer
- and uses tap devices in the host os
- and actually there are two VLC instances
- one of them sends a video stream, through the simulated network, to the other which plays it

how to build this ?

what does it need to contain?

- overview
- emulation features
- extethernet
- schematic
- how its realized
- network
- config
- scripts
- actually how to run this and what does it do
