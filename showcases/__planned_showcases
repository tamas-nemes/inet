Planned Showcases:
------------------

-Fingerprints
-Hardware-in-the-loop: real AODV, simulated network -> real BABEL in examples
-Hardware-in-the-loop: simulated AODV, real network
-Corruption mode: corruption level and its effects on protocols (independent from wifi -> APSK radio)
-Dimensional analog model
-Throughput: add ht/vht mode
-Hud (distinct logical and physical views)
