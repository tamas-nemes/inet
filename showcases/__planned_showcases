Planned Showcases:
------------------

-Fingerprints: 
-Hardware-in-the-loop: simulated AODV, real network
-Dimensional analog model: signal shape, min vs mean, 
	-> Physical Layer Signal Representation/Physical Layer Analog Domain Representation/Physical Signal Analog Domain Representation 
	unit disk/scalar/dimensional Wifi -> 
	same network; switch analog model -> when to use which one? (how to choose) for example:
		unit disk: for routing
		scalar: (unit disk not sufficient)(two wifi channels (2x2 nodes))
		dimensional: (scalar not sufficient)(complex spectral stuff)(coexistence?)(cross technology interference?)
-Modeling radio interference:
	modeling radio interference -> distinct showcase -> noise sources (bg noise with
	spectrum; noise source with spectrum (and changing in time);
	->the features of the dimensional model
	wide noise, narrow noise, 
-Corruption mode: corruption level and its effects on protocols (independent from wifi -> APSK radio)
-Emulation/videostreaming
-Emulation/basic
-Throughput: add ht/vht mode
-Hud (distinct logical and physical views)
-UWBIR-Wifi coexistence: 802.15.4 MAC + APSK UWBIR radio + arbitrary packet level error model
-packetlog window showcase
 - understanding data
 - filtering
 - configure message display
 - TODO: regular expr.
 - TODO: OSI level
